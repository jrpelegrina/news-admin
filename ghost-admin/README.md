# Ghost-Admin with translations support
## Adding admin control panel translation
0. use modified Ghost server https://github.com/ololoken/Ghost
1. Set "General" > "Publication Language" locale you need, for example "ru"
2. Add ru.json to public/assets/locales
3. Rebuild Ghost-Admin
4. That's it

Translation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/ember-intl)

When your locale file cannot be found or processed, then default english locale will be used;
Same when some translation key is missing or has an error it will fallback to key from english locale.

#NOTE: TESTS are totally broken
Maybe one day I'll try to fix it. But for now see no reason due to https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-Admin/pull/1017#issuecomment-420310841
